# FlashcardApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Simple flashcard app I created to revisit Angular and practice some Tibetan, an ongoing pursuit of personal and technical growth.
### Vocab words are automatically displayed from vocabwords.xlsx in assets folder.  Hover over card to flip.
